# AI Agent Guidance for react-template

## Your role

- You are efficient in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Sass, and React.
- Your task: implement new features and maintain existing ones in this frontend app.

## Important architectural conventions

- `/src/main.tsx` renders `<App />` inside `React.StrictMode`.
- `/src/App.tsx` is a thin wrapper that renders React Router via `RouterProvider`.
- Routing is configured in `/src/routes/router.tsx` and `/src/routes/mainRoutes.tsx`.
- The app uses `React.lazy()` and `Suspense` for route-based code splitting.
- `/src/AppProvider.tsx` provides global app-level context and wrappers.
- `/src/configs/` contains environment-specific configuration values.
- `/src/contexts/`, `/src/hooks/`, `/src/components/`, `/src/layouts/`, and `/src/redux/` contain the core app patterns.

## Best practices

- Prefer using existing code over creating new code when possible.
- Prefer relative imports when they are shorter and simpler; use `@` imports when they make the path clearer or avoid deep relative navigation.
- Prefer using `type` over `interface` when possible.
- Long and complex components should be split into smaller components or files within the same folder.
- When you split a component into smaller parts in the same folder, re-export the main component through `index.ts`.

```text
✅ Good - index re-export, folder only 1 level deep
ComplexFilter/
├───index.ts
├───ComplexFilter.tsx
├───CategorySelect.tsx
├───CategoryOption.tsx
└───useComplexFilterReducer.ts
```

```text
❌ Bad - not re-export, folder has multiple level deep
ComplexFilter/
├───ComplexFilter.tsx
├───CategorySelect/
│   ├───CategorySelect.tsx
│   └───CategoryOption.tsx
└───useComplexFilterReducer.ts

⚠️ Exception - layouts in `src/layouts` can have up to 2 folder levels deep to split Header, Sidebar, Footer into smaller components.
```

- Prefer default exports for main component files and import them using the component folder path.
- Prefer using i18n for text.
- Locale JSON keys should be `snake_case` using only lowercase letters, numbers and underscores.
- Locale JSON values should use Title Case, and paragraph text should use Sentence case ending with punctuation.

```json
{
  "about_us": "About Us",
  "about_us_line_1": "This is a long and boring introduction about myself.",
}
```

- File naming conventions:
  - React component: PascalCase (`CustomLink.tsx`)
  - React context: PascalCase (`BreakpointsContext.ts`)
  - React provider: PascalCase (`BreakpointsProvider.tsx`)
  - React hook: camelCase, prefix with `use` (`useAppDispatch.ts`)
  - Higher order component: camelCase, prefix with `with` (`withFadingOverlay.tsx`)
  - `index.*`: camelCase
  - TypeScript files with a default export: same name as the exported content.
  - Default convention: camelCase.

- Folder naming conventions:
  - Component container folder: PascalCase, same name as main component.
  - Default: camelCase.

## Boundaries

- 🚫 Never do:
  - Change the fundamental Vite/React Router architecture without a clear reason.
